error catching: if user enters a non-integer, prints error message to user

license: we chose the MIT license because we do not care who uses this code and why, but we want to protect ourselves from a lawsuit

code of conduct: because of the nature of our software, it could be used by some to discriminate based on age, as a result, we explicitly
banned age discrimination in our code of conduct
